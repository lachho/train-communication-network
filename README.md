Simulates a live rail Operation centre.
The program continuously takes in set commands from the user to replicate 
changing information to the trains such as the movemnt of passengers, and 
the creation and removal of carriages and trains. 
Simultion commands include adding passengers to different carriages, 
moving passengers through the train, adding and removing carriages
and trains, and merging and splitting trains. 
Data monitoring commands such as printing individual train capacity,  
train network capacities, and changing the selected train to interact with
was also implemented.
The program ensures there are no memory leaks. 
This program assumes there will always be at least one train in the program,
although there can exist 0 carriages.
